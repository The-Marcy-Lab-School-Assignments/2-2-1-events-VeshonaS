# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Delegation is helpful because not only is the code clearer to read due to only one eventLister being used, but also if the parent tag that has the the eventListener on it is given more children those will preform the same behavior as the rest of the children within the same parent tag.

# Teacher Feedback

Not quite, can you be a bit more specific about when we should use event delegation?
